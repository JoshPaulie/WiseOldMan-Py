# Welcome to WiseOldMan-Py

## About
WiseOldMan-Py is a simple Python wrapper for wiseoldman.net, an Old School RuneScape stat tracking site. **This package is not officially endorsed**, but the WOM dev team is aware and I'd like this to be the official Py wrapper. 

## Usage
Everything stems from the main WiseOldMan object. Various methods are used to interact with different end points, outlined below. 

## Endpoints
`/player` is accessed with `WiseOldMan.get_player()`, either by username or ID.
