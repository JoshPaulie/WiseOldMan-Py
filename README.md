# Pythonic Wise Old Man wrapper.

WiseOldMan-Py is a simple Python wrapper for [wiseoldman.net](https://wiseoldman.net/), an Old School RuneScape stat tracking site.

> 🛈 This project is in a working state, but lacks many endpoints. Contributors welcome

> 🛈 This project is not made by the WOM team. Hoping this will become the official Py wrapper. 🤞

## Example Usage

```python
import wiseoldman
from wiseoldman_py.player import Player


wom = wiseoldman.WiseOldMan()
bexlii: Player = wom.get_player("bexlii")

print(bexlii.latest_stats.attack.exp) # 2601528
```
## Endpoints
- `/player` 👉 `WiseOldMan.get_player(username=, user_id=) -> Player`
- `/player/id/achievements` 👉 `WiseOldMan.get_player(username=, user_id=) -> List[Achievement]`
