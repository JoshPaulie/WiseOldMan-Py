# Pythonic Wise Old Man wrapper.

WiseOldMan-Py is a simple Python wrapper for [wiseoldman.net](https://wiseoldman.net/), an Old School RuneScape stat tracking site.

> ðŸ›ˆ This project is in a working state, but lacks many endpoints. Contributors welcome

> ðŸ›ˆ This project is not made by the WOM team. Hoping this will become the official Py wrapper. ðŸ¤ž

## Example Usage

```python
import wiseoldman
from wiseoldman_py.player import Player


wom = wiseoldman.WiseOldMan()
bexlii: Player = wom.get_player("bexlii")

print(bexlii.latest_snapshot.attack.exp) # 2601528
```
## Endpoints

### Player

- `/player/<id>/achievements` ðŸ‘‰ `Player.get_achievements() -> List[Achievement]`

### Groups
