# Pythonic Wise Old Man wrapper.

This project is in a working state, but lacks many features.

You can add me on discord [here](https://discordapp.com/users/177131156028784640) if you are interested in helping me package this up for others to use.

## Example Usage

```python
import wiseoldman

wom = wiseoldman.WiseOldMan()
bexlii = wom.get_player("bexlii")

print(bexlii.latest_stats.attack.exp) # 2601528
```
